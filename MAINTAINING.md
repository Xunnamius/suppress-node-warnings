# Maintaining

This is documentation for maintainers of this project.

## Code of Conduct

Please [review][1], understand, and be an example of it. Violations of the code
of conduct are taken seriously, even (especially) for maintainers.

## Issues

We want to support and build the community. We do that best by helping people
learn to solve their own problems. We have an issue template and hopefully most
folks follow it. If it's not clear what the issue is, invite them to create a
minimal reproduction of what they're trying to accomplish or the bug they think
they've found.

Once it's determined that a code change is necessary, point people to
[makeapullrequest.com][2] and invite them to make a pull request. If they're the
one who needs the feature, they're the one who can build it. If they need some
hand holding and you have time to lend a hand, please do so. It's an investment
into another human being, and an investment into a potential maintainer.

Remember that this is open source, so the code is not yours, it's ours. If
someone needs a change in the codebase, you don't have to make it happen
yourself. Commit as much time to the project as you want/need to. Nobody can ask
any more of you than that.

## Pull Requests

As a maintainer, you're fine to make your branches on the main repo or on your
own fork. Either way is fine.

When we receive a pull request, a GitHub Actions build is kicked off
automatically (see [`.github/workflows`][3]). We avoid merging anything that
fails the Actions workflow.

Please review PRs and focus on the code rather than the individual. You never
know when this is someone's first ever PR and we want their experience to be as
positive as possible, so be uplifting and constructive.

When you merge the pull request, 99% of the time you should use the [rebase and
merge][4] feature. This keeps our git history clean. If commit messages need to
be adjusted, maintainers should force push new commits with adjusted messages to
the PR branch before merging it in.

The [squash and merge][5] feature can also be used, but keep in mind that
squashing commits will likely damage the [generated][6] [CHANGELOG.md][7],
hinder [bisection][8], and result in [non-atomic commits][9], so use it
sparingly.

## Release

Our releases are automatic. They happen whenever code lands into `master`. A
GitHub Actions build gets kicked off and, if it's successful, a tool called
[`semantic-release`][10] is used to automatically publish a new release to npm
and GitHub along with an updated changelog. It is only able to determine the
version and whether a release is necessary by the git commit messages. With this
in mind, **please brush up on [the commit message convention][commit] which
drives our releases.**

> One important note about this: please make sure that commit messages do NOT
> contain the words "BREAKING CHANGE" in them unless we want to push a major
> version. I've been burned by this more than once where someone will include
> "BREAKING CHANGE: None" and it will end up releasing a new major version. Do
> not do this!

### Manual Releases

This project has an automated release set up. That means things are only
released when there are useful changes in the code that justify a release. See
[the release rules][11] for a list of commit types that trigger releases.

However, sometimes things get messed up (e.g. CI workflow / GitHub Actions
breaks) and we need to trigger a release ourselves. When this happens,
semantic-release can be triggered locally by following these steps:

> If one of these steps fails, you should address the failure before running the
> next step.

```bash
# These commands must be run from the project root. It is recommended to clone a
# fresh version of the repo to a temp directory and run these commands from
# there.

# 1. Install dependencies and add your auth tokens to the .env file.
# ! DO NOT COMMIT THE .env FILE !
cp .env.default .env
npm ci

# 2. Reset the working directory to a clean state (deletes all ignored files).
npm run clean

# 3. Lint all files.
npm run lint:all

# 4. Build distributables.
npm run build:dist

# 5. Build any external executables (used in GitHub Actions workflows).
npm run build:externals

# 6. Format all files.
npm run format

# 7. Build auxiliary documentation (AFTER format so line numbers are correct).
npm run build:docs

# 8. Run all possible tests and generate coverage information.
npm run test:all

# 9. Upload coverage information to codecov (only if you have the proper token).
CODECOV_TOKEN=$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p CODECOV_TOKEN) codecov

# 10. Trigger semantic-release locally and generate a new release. This requires
# having tokens for NPM and GitHub with the appropriate permissions.
#
# Do a dry run first:
NPM_TOKEN="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p NPM_TOKEN)" GH_TOKEN="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GITHUB_TOKEN)" HUSKY=0 UPDATE_CHANGELOG=true GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_AUTHOR_NAME)" GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_COMMITTER_NAME)" GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL)" GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL)" npx --no-install semantic-release --no-ci --extends "$(pwd)/release.config.js" --dry-run
# Then do the actual publish:
NPM_TOKEN="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p NPM_TOKEN)" GH_TOKEN="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GITHUB_TOKEN)" HUSKY=0 UPDATE_CHANGELOG=true GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_AUTHOR_NAME)" GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_COMMITTER_NAME)" GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL)" GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$(npx --yes dotenv-cli -p GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL)" npx --no-install semantic-release --no-ci --extends "$(pwd)/release.config.js"
```
