## Functions

### suppressWarnings

â–¸ **suppressWarnings**(`name?`): `void`

Places a filter in front of all current `'warning'` event handlers attached
to `globalThis.process`. This filter quietly swallows any warning events
matching `name` while letting others pass through like normal.

Also looks for a `NODE_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS` environment variable and parses its
contents as comma-separated values that are trimmed and appended to the
`name` array. For example:
`NODE_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS=ExperimentalWarning,DeprecationWarning node
my-thing.js`.

**IMPORTANT: Imports that might generate warnings must occur _AFTER_ this
function is executed. If warning suppression isn't working for you, it means
you must use _dynamic imports_, and they must occur _AFTER_ this function is
executed.**

On the other hand, imports that might add additional `'warning'` event
handlers must occur _BEFORE_ this function is executed. Any handlers added
after this function executes will not be suppressed.

Common warning names include:

- `"DeprecationWarning"`
- `"ExperimentalWarning"`
- `"MaxListenersExceededWarning"`
- `"TimeoutOverflowWarning"`
- `"UnsupportedWarning"`

Note that this function does not rely on any horrifying hacks redefining
`process.emit` or anything crazy like that.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Default value |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
